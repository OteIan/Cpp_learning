# 1.2 Project for CAT

`Task`: Modify [this file](../Abstract_Data_Type/Linked_lists/SortedStack.cpp) so that the node stores all the 
units done by the student in Electrical Engineering First year class. The node should store the aggregate score and the mean grade of the student.
When dispalying the students and their information, the code should be able to sort in each of the following ways:
* Age (Descending)
* Registration number (Ascending)
* Grade in each unit (Descending)
* Aggregate grade (Descending)
* Mean grade (Ascending)

Node format => | `Reg No.` | `Name` | `Age` | `Gender` | `Units...` | `Aggregate` | `Mean Grade` |
